# parking_lot_problem

Q-   It should provide us with an interactive command prompt based
    shell where commands can be typed in

It should accept a filename as a parameter at the command prompt
and read the commands from that file


Commands are,


create_parking_lot

park KA01R9988 Yellow

unpark KA01R9977

find_parking_slot 5

find_car_number KL01R6699

find_car blue
